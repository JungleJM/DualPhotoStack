# Build Fix Log

This document tracks all changes made to fix automated build issues.

## Build Attempt #1 - FAILED
**Date:** 2025-06-25
**Commit:** 92e0fe3 (Add automated builds and comprehensive logging system)
**Error:** `npm ci` requires package-lock.json file
**Details:** The GitHub Actions workflow uses `npm ci` for faster, reproducible builds, but there's no package-lock.json file in the electron-app directory.

## Fix #1 - Generate package-lock.json
**Action:** 
1. Fixed electron-reload version from `^2.0.0` to `^1.5.0` (2.0.0 doesn't exist)
2. Run `npm install` locally to generate package-lock.json
**Rationale:** `npm ci` requires a lock file for deterministic builds. We need to generate one from the existing package.json.
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - package-lock.json generated successfully

## Build Attempt #2 - SUCCESS ✅
**Date:** 2025-06-25
**Commit:** 8f47300 (Fix build issues: package-lock.json and dependency versions)
**Result:** BUILD SUCCESSFUL 
**Duration:** 1m 21s

## Summary of All Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Fixed electron-reload dependency version (^2.0.0 → ^1.5.0)
2. ✅ Generated package-lock.json for reproducible builds
